                    Imagine you are in a university residence, where you can meet a great amount of people. NTMY, giving you the opportunity to organise thematic events, will help you to meet new friends!
                </p>
                <p>
                    The user can interact with the system using a wearable and a smartphone. With the app you can create a new meeting/event in the residence to meet new people (like watch a football match on tv or do a card game). The system will then set a specific location for the event (considering the type of the event and the free residence's place) and it will assign it a colour; the user’s wearable will turn that colour too (e.g. blue). Whenever a new event is created, people in the college with the same interests get a notification and, if they decide to participate at the blue event, their wearables will become blue as well. The lights in the reserved room will also become blue to indicate that the room will host the blue event, and in the main streets of the residence some indicators will color of blue, to easily find the place.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The system also acts according to the category of the meeting (e.g. event with TV, board game event, generic discussion event, music event/dance, sporting event), adjusting the lights, the video (tv) and the audio.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then, when you are at the event and greet someone, the system will recognise your action and register the personal information of your new friend (such as name, photo, phone number, Facebook/Instagram, ...), so that at the end of the day you can remember who you met. No more forgotten names or time lost in exchanging phone numbers!

        <div id="goal" class="section">
            <div class="container">
                <h1>Project goal</h1>
                <p>
                    The goal of the project is to build a system that can be used in university residences to smartly organize event in order to let people meet others with the same interests. For this purpose, it makes use of different kinds of electronic devices such as PCs, mini computers, smartphones and wearables, all of which contribute to solve different problems that can be experienced during the organization of an event.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The system can improve the management of the rooms in the residence, allocating events in order to maximize the number of participants and find the most suitable room for any kind of event. This process is carried on the central server, that will run an optimization algotithm and generate, for each day, the best events schedule to maximize a number of different target functions such as the number of participants.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once the event has been scheduled, the system will also help in the phase of the room preparation. Every room will be equipped with a Raspberry computer that will interface with the central server and prepare the ambient in order to make it as enjoyable as possible. It will be able to intelligently control the lights, the TV and the audio systems according to the category of the event choosen and to the number of users taking part of it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Smart panels will be put in the intersection of the residence, to help the participants to find their way to the events. Whenever an user passes near one of them, the system will identify his wearable (via Bluetooth) and indicate the right direction to reach the specific event room. The panel is controlled by a Raspberry computer, that will dinamically search for the direction making use of a shortest path algorithm on a graph representing the map of the residence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, the last problem our system aims to solve is related to the personal information that people share when they first meet, that are often not so easy to remember. In order not to spoil the simplicity of the interaction, our system makes use of an Android Wear smartwatch capable of recognizing the users when they handshake, informing the server that a connection has been made; users can then check the information on the people they met on their phone.
