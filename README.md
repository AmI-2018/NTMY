# [Nice To Meet You](https://ami-2018.github.io/NTMY/)

NTMY is an Ambient Intelligence system that aims to help students in university residences to meet new friends by letting the users organize thematic events.
## Vision
Imagine you are in a university residence, where you can meet a great amount of people. NTMY, giving you the opportunity to organise thematic events, will help you to meet new friends!

The user can interact with the system using a wearable and a smartphone. With the app you can create a new meeting/event in the residence to meet new people (like watch a football match on tv or do a card game). The system will then set a specific location for the event (considering the type of the event and the free residence's place) and it will assign it a colour; the user’s wearable will turn that colour too (e.g. blue). Whenever a new event is created, people in the college with the same interests get a notification and, if they decide to participate at the blue event, their wearables will become blue as well. The lights in the reserved room will also become blue to indicate that the room will host the blue event, and in the main streets of the residence some indicators will color of blue, to easily find the place.

The system also acts according to the category of the meeting (e.g. event with TV, board game event, generic discussion event, music event/dance, sporting event), adjusting the lights, the video (tv) and the audio.
  
Then, when you are at the event and greet someone, the system will recognise your action and register the personal information of your new friend (such as name, photo, phone number, Facebook/Instagram, ...), so that at the end of the day you can remember who you met. No more forgotten names or time lost in exchanging phone numbers!
